<p> Over the past decade, Samsung’s mobile evolution has been defined by a dramatic shift from experimental hardware designs to a mature, diversified ecosystem led by foldables and artificial intelligence.

In the mid-2010s, the company moved away from plastic builds to premium glass-and-metal aesthetics, pioneering the curved "Edge" displays that eventually led to today's near-bezel-less Infinity-O screens. A major turning point occurred in 2019 with the launch of the Galaxy Z series, which successfully transitioned foldable phones from conceptual prototypes into mainstream consumer devices like the Z Fold and Z Flip, effectively creating a new market category. Simultaneously, Samsung revolutionized mobile photography by standardizing multi-lens arrays and introducing "Space Zoom" periscope telephoto lenses, while their most recent strategy has pivoted toward software longevity and generative Galaxy AI, marking a transition from purely chasing hardware specifications to refining the overall user experience. </p>
