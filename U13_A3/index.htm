The most powerful iPhone ever, is here!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreenstyle style="float: right; padding-left: 20px;">></iframe> 

<p> Across the iPhone 17 Pro camera system, you’ll find innovation that goes to great lengths. This includes the longest iPhone Telephoto ever, up to an equivalent 200mm focal length, with the next generation of our tetraprism design and 56 per cent larger sensor. So you can explore an even wider range of creative choices and add a longer reach to your compositions with 16x optical zoom range. And capture stunning low-light photographs and incredible video. The new front camera gives you flexible ways to frame your photos and videos — and so much more. Tap to expand the field of view and rotate from portrait to landscape without moving your iPhone. And when others join the shot, the field of view expands so you get more friends in your selfies. From home movies to Hollywood productions, iPhone 17 Pro is up to any challenge. With more pro video features than ever — like enhanced video stabilisation, cinema-grade specs and compatibility with industry-standard workflows — iPhone 17 Pro puts powerful filmmaking tools within reach, wherever you need them. Whether you’re working with intensive graphics or massive media files, iPhone 17 Pro offers blazing-fast performance — with advanced cooling technology. An Apple-designed laser-welded vapour chamber works with the aluminium unibody structure to efficiently move heat away from the A19 Pro chip, allowing for even higher sustained performance. This breakthrough in thermal management is key to the most powerful iPhone ever created. The new internal design creates significant additional room for battery capacity, giving iPhone 17 Pro Max the best-ever iPhone battery life,9 and up to 3 more hours per full charge compared to iPhone 15 Pro Max. From extended video playback to after-hours work, it’s always ready for overtime. </p>

<p> The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra features a powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, a stunning anti-reflective 6.9" QHD+ 120Hz display, an advanced 200MP camera system with AI enhancements, integrated S Pen with gesture controls, a titanium build, long battery life, and deep Galaxy AI features like Live Translate and Circle to Search, running Android 15 with One UI 8 for a premium, smart user experience. The question is, is the Galaxy S25 Ultra worth it? THe answer is. Yes, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is generally considered worth it for power users wanting the best Android experience, boasting top-tier performance (Snapdragon 8 Elite), an exceptional anti-glare screen, powerful cameras, great battery, and advanced AI features, making it a top flagship, though some find the S Pen features "nerfed" or design too similar to past models, especially if upgrading from an S24 Ultra.  This device introduces Corning® Gorilla® Armor 2, the industry's first scratch-resistant, anti-reflective glass ceramic cover material for mobile devices, on the front display and Corning® Gorilla® Glass Victus® 2 on the back panel.</p>
